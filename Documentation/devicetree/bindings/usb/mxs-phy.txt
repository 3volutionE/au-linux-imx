* Freescale MXS USB Phy Device

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx23-usbphy"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain phy interrupt
- usbphy_reg_at_anatop: if there is any registers at anatop domain
- usbphy_need_disconnect_line_feature: at some platforms (like i.mx6),
if both phys power is off, the status of dp/dm will be uncertain.
At that time, there will be unknown wakeup. With this flag, we can
avoid this unknown wakeup interrupt
- usbphy_need_open_regulator_at_lpm: for some SoCs(like imx6), the
phy's regulator is from the SoC power, when SoC enters lpm, this
power will be off, but if we want to support usb as system wakeup
source, these regulators need to be on.


Example:
usbphy1: usbphy@020c9000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-usbphy", "fsl,imx23-usbphy";
	reg = <0x020c9000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 44 0x04>;
	usbphy_reg_at_anatop;
	usbphy_need_disconnect_line_feature;
	usbphy_need_open_regulator_at_lpm;
};
