Boundary Devices Kernel tree for i.MX6.

This repository contains kernel source trees for Boundary Devices'
i.MX6 based boards:

* [BD-SL-i.MX6 (SABRE Lite)][sabrelite]
* [Nitrogen6X][nitrogen6x]
* [Nitrogen6X SOM][nitrogen6x-som]
* [Nitrogen6X SOM v2][nitrogen6x-somv2]
* [Nitrogen6 Lite][nitrogen6-lite]
* [Nitrogen6 MAX][nitrogen6-max]
* [Nitrogen6 VM][nitrogen6-vm]
* [Nitrogen6 SoloX][nitrogen6-sx]
* [Nitrogen7][nitrogen7]
* [Nitrogen8M][nitrogen8m]

It is based largely on Freescale's kernel trees at [git.freescale.com][freescale].
